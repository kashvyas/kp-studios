# CLAUDE.md — APEX Launch Copilot

## Product intent
Build the smallest reliable system that helps an AI PM decide whether a feature is ready to ship.

## Operating rules
1. Prefer explicit tools and typed state over hidden prompt context.
2. Never infer a missing release metric. Mark it missing and fail closed for critical gates.
3. Keep launch thresholds in policy/data, not scattered through prose.
4. Every decision must include evidence and a trace of tools used.
5. Preserve deterministic release gates; LLM-generated text must never override them.
6. Add or update a golden-set test for every behavior change.
7. Treat Responsible AI, incident status, and rollback readiness as release requirements.
8. Avoid collecting or storing user-level or wagering data in this portfolio project.

## Definition of done
A change is done only when:
- unit tests pass,
- golden-set decision accuracy is 100%,
- guardrail recall is 100%,
- no critical release gate can silently pass with missing data,
- README or decision memo is updated if behavior changes.

## Product review checklist
- What business/user problem changed?
- What new failure mode did we introduce?
- Which metric proves the change is better?
- Which golden case proves it?
- What is the rollback path?
