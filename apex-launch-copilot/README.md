# APEX Launch Copilot — AI Product Leadership Proof

A compact portfolio prototype built to demonstrate **AI-native product management craft**: agentic workflow design, retrieval/context engineering, tool use, MCP exposure, eval-first release gates, observability, and responsible-AI decisioning.

> **Important:** This is a synthetic portfolio project. It does not use FanDuel systems, data, policies, or proprietary information.

## What it does

The copilot answers one high-value PM question:

**“Should this AI feature ship?”**

It combines:
- a lightweight retrieval layer over product/release policy,
- structured tool calls for eval results, incidents, and feature metadata,
- deterministic release-gate logic,
- citations to the retrieved policy snippets,
- trace output showing which tools and evidence were used,
- a golden-set evaluation harness for regression testing.

## Why this matters for AI product leadership

The design demonstrates the ability to:
- translate ambiguous business questions into an agent-shaped workflow,
- define “good” numerically before launch,
- use tools rather than stuffing all context into a prompt,
- expose reusable capabilities through MCP,
- instrument output quality and regressions,
- preserve responsible-AI and release controls.

## 5-minute demo

```bash
python -m src.apex_launch_copilot.demo
python -m evals.run_evals
```

Example question:

> Can campaign-copilot-v17 ship to 100% of users on Friday?

The system returns:
- **SHIP / HOLD / LIMITED ROLLOUT**
- reasons tied to release thresholds
- policy evidence
- tool trace
- failed gates

## Optional MCP server

The core demo has no external dependencies. To expose the tools through the current MCP Python SDK:

```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]>=2,<3"
python mcp_server.py
```

The server exposes:
- `get_feature_status`
- `get_eval_result`
- `get_incident_status`
- `assess_release`

```

## Core product metrics

The prototype treats AI quality as a product surface. The eval harness checks:
- **decision accuracy** — expected release decision
- **citation coverage** — answer cites relevant policy evidence
- **tool-use correctness** — required tools were invoked
- **guardrail recall** — critical failure conditions are caught
- **regression rate** — golden cases that changed unexpectedly

## Design choice: deterministic release gate

The release decision is intentionally deterministic. An LLM may help summarize or explain evidence, but it should not be the final authority for a launch gate with explicit thresholds. This keeps the decision:
- auditable,
- testable,
- reproducible,
- easy to override with policy changes.

That is the product point of the prototype: **use AI where ambiguity exists; keep hard controls hard.**
